[130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)

# 题目
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

# 样例
```
Input:
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
Output:
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

# 思路
把所有不和边缘接壤的“O”变成“X”。

对于一片相邻的“O”区域，我们可以用dfs进行遍历。那么如果要求不和边缘接壤，我们只需要第一个pass把所有和边缘接壤的区域标识出来（可以用额外的空间，但更好的是在原矩阵上用一个新的符号”D“代替），然后在第二个pass，把”D“变成”O“，把”O“变成”X“即可。

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        if not board:
            return None
	
        m , n  = len(board) , len(board[0])
            
        def dfs(i,j):                              
            if board[i][j] == "O":
                board[i][j] = 'D'
                for x , y in [(i+1,j), (i-1,j), (i,j+1), (i,j-1)]:
                    if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n:
                        dfs(x,y) 
                            
        for i in range(m):
            dfs(i,0)
            dfs(i,n-1)
        
        for i in range(n):
            dfs(0 ,i)
            dfs(m-1 ,i)
            
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j]== 'D' :
                    board[i][j] = "O"
                else:
                    board[i][j] = "X"
